    body: "<p>You probably won’t be shocked to hear that homeowners in catastrophe-prone states like Florida and Louisiana typically pay more for their insurance. What may be a surprise is just how much home hardening can help keep costs down.</p>\n<p>Hardening your home against risk reduces your likelihood of filing a claim. That’s a win for you because it helps you <a href=\"/blog/controlling-home-insurance-costs/\">control your insurance costs</a> while also saving you from dealing with repairs. But fewer claims is also a win for your insurance company, which is why so many of us give discounts for home hardening.</p>\n<p>We’ve put together a list of our top home hardening tips. But first, let’s get on the same page about what home hardening is.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatishomehardening\">What is home hardening?</h2>\n<p>“Home hardening” refers to steps you can take to make your house more resilient against risks that may damage it. That often means identifying your home’s vulnerabilities and using better building materials and practices to reinforce them long before trouble approaches. In some cases, hardening your home brings it in line with modern building codes.</p>\n<p>Homes are often vulnerable at entry points, like windows and doors. But you also want to consider what sort of <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a> your home faces. For example, if you live along a coastline, you probably know that your roof can also be vulnerable to high winds.</p>\n<p>We organized our home hardening tips by peril, so you can focus on the risks most common in your area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hurricanesandwindstorms\">Hurricanes and windstorms</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/home-hardening-tips.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Our members in Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina face more risk for hurricanes than much of the nation. If you’re one of them, hardening your homes against hurricanes and windstorms is a top priority. You can start by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investing in <a href=\"/blog/impact-resistant-windows/\">impact-resistant windows</a> and doors. If that’s out of reach, <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">hurricane shutters</a> are your next best bet.</li>\n<li>Getting a professional to install <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-clips/\">hurricane clips</a>.</li>\n<li>Installing a wind- and impact-rated garage door.</li>\n<li>Checking that your <a href=\"https://www.jlconline.com/how-to/exteriors/securing-soffits_o\">soffits were property installed</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.floridadisaster.org/hrg/content/roofs/bracing.asp\">Retrofitting gable ends</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hardening your home against hurricanes and windstorms is so important in many catastrophe-prone areas that state legislators create incentives for <a href=\"/glossary/wind-mitigation/\">wind mitigation</a>. These can come in the form of grant programs, insurance premium discounts, and tax breaks. Below are a few examples of the incentives we found for wind mitigation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"florida\">Florida</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://mysafeflhome.com/\">My Safe Florida Home Program</a> provides free hurricane inspections to Florida homeowners. In some areas, eligible homeowners can also apply for a matching grant to retrofit their homes.</p>\n<p>To be eligible for a matching grant, you must have been granted a <a href=\"/blog/florida-homestead-exemption/\">homestead exemption</a> and agree to make your home available for inspection once a mitigation project has been completed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, your home must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have an insured value of $500,000 or less.</li>\n<li>Have undergone an acceptable hurricane mitigation inspection after July 1, 2008.</li>\n<li>Be located in the “wind-borne debris region” as that term is defined in the Florida building code.</li>\n<li>Have a building permit application for initial construction of the home must have been made before March 1, 2002.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also save money on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners in Florida</a> when you mitigate your wind risk, so talk to your insurer about discounts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"louisiana\">Louisiana</h3>\n<p>The Louisiana Department of Insurance offers <a href=\"https://www.ldi.la.gov/consumers/insurance-type/homeowners/hurricane-resource-center/storm-mitigation-incentives\">storm mitigation incentives</a> to eligible homeowners who voluntarily harden their homes against hurricanes. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>State tax deductions.</strong> Homeowners who retrofit their properties so they’re compliant with the State Uniform Construction Code may be eligible for a tax deduction equal to 50% of the cost of retrofitting, minus any other state, municipal, or federal incentives. The deduction is not available for rental properties.</li>\n<li><strong>Sales tax exclusions.</strong> Hurricane storm shutters are excluded from sales tax in Louisiana.</li>\n<li><strong>Premium discounts.</strong> Insurance companies are required to offer discounts on <a href=\"/home-insurance/louisiana/\">Louisiana homeowners insurance</a> on homes that are built or retrofitted to comply with the State Uniform Construction Code. Homeowners who make install damage mitigation improvements or who retrofit their homes using construction methods to reduce wind damage may also be eligible for premium discounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Insurance companies may ask homeowners who want premium discounts to complete a <a href=\"https://www.ldi.la.gov/docs/default-source/documents/propertycasualty/louisiana-hurricane-loss-mitigation-survey-form.pdf?sfvrsn=90f97652_6\">Louisiana Hurricane Loss Mitigation Form</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"southcarolina\">South Carolina</h3>\n<p>State law requires insures to offer premium discounts on <a href=\"/home-insurance/south-carolina/\">South Carolina homeowners insurance</a> for wind mitigation, with an average <a href=\"https://doi.sc.gov/DocumentCenter/View/9573/Homeowners-Mitigation-Credits---Brochure-Sept-2016?bidId\">maximum credit of 48%</a> in coastal communities.</p>\n<p>South Carolina also offers the <a href=\"https://www.doi.sc.gov/605/SC-Safe-Home\">SC Safe Home Mitigation Grant Program</a>. Administered by the state’s Department of Insurance, the program provides matching and non-matching funds for homeowners who harden their homes against hurricane winds. The grants are only available for owner-occupied, single-family homes and only apply to retrofitting.</p>\n<p>South Carolina homeowners can also <a href=\"https://www.doi.sc.gov/DocumentCenter/View/9335/Mitigation-Credits-Display-Card-Final-2016?bidId=\">earn tax credits</a> for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Retrofit project costs.</strong> The maximum credit available for project expenses like labor and materials is either 25% of the total costs or $1,000, whichever is less.</li>\n<li><strong>Retrofit supplies costs.</strong> Homeowners can get a tax credit of up to $1,500 on the purchase of tangible personal property used in a qualified fortification project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Qualified fortification projects must be on your legal residence and include things like roof covering construction and renovations on roof attachments, roof-to-wall attachments, secondary water resistance, and opening protections.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mississippi\">Mississippi</h3>\n<p>Wind mitigation can also get you a discount on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/mississippi/\">home insurance in Mississippi</a> through the state’s <a href=\"https://www.mid.ms.gov/mitigation/mitigation.aspx\">wind mitigation program</a>. It offers a free inspection that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Describes ways you can harden your home against wind damage.</li>\n<li>Includes an estimate of how much those improvements will cost.</li>\n<li>Estimates the available insurance discounts.</li>\n<li>Provides a hurricane rating for your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mississippi homeowners who take part in the program may be eligible for matching grants to reimburse you for the cost of the improvements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Home insurance</a> generally only covers sudden, accidental water damage from internal sources (like a pipe bursting), so hardening your home against flooding is important. This may be particularly true if you live near the coast and need protection against storm surge, but floods can actually happen anywhere.</p>\n<p>Long story short, you may invest in some of the fortifications to protect your home from flood damage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using stilts or piers to raise your house above the flood level.</li>\n<li>Moving appliances, electrical outlets, and water-sensitive equipment to higher floors.</li>\n<li>Installing backflow or gate valves.</li>\n<li>Creating enclosed spaces that allow water in (i.e., wetproofing).</li>\n<li>Installing and <a href=\"/blog/sump-pump-maintenance/\">maintaining a sump pump</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"wildfires\">Wildfires</h2>\n<p>Most people think of wildfires as a problem for western states – and they’re not wrong. California saw <a href=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2022/\">7,490 wildfires</a> in 2022. But that’s not the only state where homeowners may need to harden their homes against this peril. Florida, for instance, has had <a href=\"https://www.fdacs.gov/Forest-Wildfire/Wildland-Fire/Current-Wildfire-Information\">717 fires</a> as of this writing.</p>\n<p>Some ideas for hardening your home against wildfire include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating a <a href=\"/blog/defensible-space/\">defensible space</a> around your house.</li>\n<li>Choosing fire resistant roofing materials, like clay, metal, or tile.</li>\n<li>Looking for fire resistant <a href=\"/blog/house-siding-options/\">siding options</a>, like stone, brick, or fiber cement.</li>\n<li>Covering your chimney with mesh with holes that are at least ⅜-inch wide but no more than ½-inch wide.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"5morewaystoreducehomeinsuranceclaims\">5 more ways to reduce home insurance claims</h2>\n<p>We highly recommend hardening your home against the risks in your area, but we also realize that a lot of these tips are pretty expensive. Some involve major renovations and most require hiring professionals, which may mean you have to save up before you can get started fortifying your home.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, here are some additional tips to help <a href=\"/faq/how-to-prevent-claims/\">prevent insurance claims</a> or at least minimize damage when trouble starts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Get a water leak detector.</strong> Installing a water leak monitoring device can reduce damage by notifying you of a leak. Some can even shut off water to your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Install gutter guards.</strong> Gutter guards keep your gutter free of debris so water can flow through easily. As a bonus, reducing the amount of debris in your gutter also makes it less likely for a flying ember to spark a flame during a wildfire.</li>\n<li><strong>Buy surge protectors.</strong> A large <a href=\"/blog/what-causes-a-power-surge/\">power surge</a> can fry your electrical system. Home insurance often covers that kind of damage, but a surge protector can save you from the headache of repairs.</li>\n<li><strong>Trim your trees.</strong> Regularly pruning your trees can minimize the chance of unhealthy branches falling through your roof, especially during a storm.</li>\n<li><strong>Consider a home warranty.</strong> A <a href=\"/glossary/home-warranty/\">home warranty</a> can address problems that home insurance doesn’t, like repairs when an appliance malfunctions. Some homeowners find that having a home warranty helps them keep small issues from becoming major claims.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While none of these can replace quality home insurance, they can go a long way toward curtailing claims and controlling your costs.

    body: "<p>One of your main jobs as a homeowner is to maintain your home. And home maintenance isn’t just something to keep your neighbors from complaining: it’s an essential investment in the value of your property, whether you plan to sell in a few years or stay forever.</p>\n<p>Many first-time homeowners don’t realize home maintenance is something they’re expected to do when they buy a <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> policy. Most home insurance policies explicitly exclude damage from “neglect” or “failure to properly maintain the property.”</p>\n<p>Translation: your insurance policy doesn’t cover things that fall apart because you didn’t take care of them. It only covers damage from acute, unexpected events.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we’ve put together a home maintenance guide for new homeowners. It includes two sections:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>A descriptive guide to various maintenance tasks, organized by season</strong>. Read through this section to get an idea of what kinds of home maintenance you should do and why. In each section, we’ve also indicated which part of your homeowners insurance policy each task corresponds to – e.g., checking your smoke detector helps prevent fires, which connects to the property coverage portion of your insurance.</li>\n<li><strong>A chart with links to DIY guides for each task, along with cost estimates for outsourcing</strong>. Head to this section for an in-depth look at what it costs (in time and money) to keep a home in good shape.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"part1homemaintenancetipsbyseason\">Part 1: Home maintenance tips by season</h2>\n<h3 id=\"homemaintenancetipsforspring\">Home maintenance tips for spring</h3>\n<p><strong>Dates</strong>: March 20 – June 20</p>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong>: 14 weeks</p>\n<p>From a home maintenance perspective, spring is a busy season. That might not seem too bad, though, after a cold winter. In fact, you’re probably looking for chances to get outside and enjoy the fresh air. Proper maintenance gives you plenty of opportunities.</p>\n<h4 id=\"propertyinsurancerelatedhomemaintenance\">Property insurance-related home maintenance</h4>\n<p>In addition to generally making your home safer and nicer-looking, these maintenance tasks will help minimize the likelihood that you’ll have to make a claim on the property portion of your homeowners insurance, which offers coverage for damage to the the <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">physical structure of your home</a> and your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal possessions</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Inspect your trees</strong>: Really, you might want to have a professional take a look. The goal is to detect any dead branches or rot that could kill branches, which can damage your home (or your neighbors’), catch fire, and seriously injure guests.</li>\n<li><strong>Check and clean your gutters</strong>: If the winter was icy or snowy, they may be pulling away from the house, which makes you susceptible to water damage down the line. And keep in mind: if <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">water comes from outside your house</a>, your homeowners insurance probably won’t pay for the repairs.</li>\n<li><strong>Inspect the outside of your house</strong>: Take a walk around the property to look for anything that needs fixing: cracks in cement, missing shingles, loose steps, etc. Make or schedule repairs as needed to keep your home well sealed and safe.</li>\n<li><strong>Remove creeping plants</strong>: Plants growing too close to your foundation could lead to cracks, which can let water in, which can cause all sorts of problems. Don your favorite gardening gloves, put on a podcast, and pull out (or replant!) plants getting too close to your foundation.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your sump pump</strong>: This is classic home maintenance in that it’s something most people have to be reminded to do because when it works, it’s invisible. Your sump pump pumps water out of your house to a place it won’t cause problems; if it stops working, water will build up in your basement and cause all the problems excess water causes (<a href=\"/is-mold-covered-by-home-insurance\">mold</a>, mildew, rot, etc.). Expect to need a new sump pump every seven to 10 years.</li>\n<li><strong>Give your plumbing a once-over</strong>: Check for dripping faucets and running toilets. Even better: look in the tank of your toilets to see how the flapper valve is doing. Worn flappers cause toilets to run, so you can prevent this problem by catching it in time (and take it from us: you’ll feel like a real hero if you do).</li>\n<li><strong>Check smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors</strong>: Preventing fire damage is much easier with a working smoke detector, but we all need a reminder to check our alarms. Consider doing it every time you change your clocks so it gets baked into your routine.</li>\n<li><strong>Check and clean your chimney</strong> (if you have one). Burning wood creates a substance called creosote, which is highly flammable and can build up if not cleaned out regularly. Removing creosote is the main goal of chimney maintenance; failing to do so can significantly increase your chance of a chimney fire.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Life expectancy of a sump pump: 7 – 10 years</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"liabilityinsurancerelatedhomemaintenance\">Liability insurance-related home maintenance</h4>\n<p>Homeowners insurance does more than pay to repair your house and its contents if something goes wrong. It also offers payments if a guest is injured while visiting. These home maintenance tips will help prevent the kinds of insurance claims that would be covered by the <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability</a> portion of your home insurance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check the driveway and sidewalks for cracks and damage, making repairs as necessary</strong>. Water can get in small cracks and freeze during the winter, making cracks larger and leading to uneven surfaces. Patching and repairing these can prevent trips and falls, especially in wet or dark conditions.</li>\n<li><strong>Prep your pool for summer</strong> (if you have one). In addition to all the normal things you do to get your <a href=\"/blog/swimming-pool-insurance-requirements/\">pool</a> ready for swimming, make sure the area around it is free of tripping hazards, spiny plants, and other things that could hurt your guests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"generalupkeephomemaintenance\">General upkeep home maintenance</h4>\n<p>Of course, not every bit of home maintenance ties directly to homeowners insurance. These springtime efforts won’t necessarily prevent any major insurance claims, but they will help maintain (or boost) your property value, which is good news for you and your neighbors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reboot your lawn</strong>: Clear off winter debris, mulch your gardens, and turn your hoses back on. Consider ditching the classic (and <a href=\"https://earther.gizmodo.com/lawns-are-an-ecological-disaster-1826070720\">energy-guzzling</a>) lawn altogether and plant native wildflowers or other suitable options for your climate. Hint: you may be able to get around strict local lawn-care ordinances by certifying your native-plant lawn as a wildlife habitat with your local Department of Natural Resources.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your maintenance equipment</strong>: Check that your lawn mower is in good shape, and get it serviced if necessary. As many as 35,000 people in the United States visit the ER every year for lawn mower-related injuries, so this may be a job best left to a professional. These injuries are associated with power mowers; if you’d like a safer option, choose a push mower (you’ll also save money on gas!).</li>\n<li><strong>Deep clean your house</strong>: Spring cleaning can be a rewarding part of home maintenance because there’s suddenly much more daylight to see all the dirt and dust that’s been gathering. Put on some tunes and get out the mop!</li>\n<li><strong>Clean outdoor spaces</strong>: Patios and decks usually need a thorough cleaning after winter. If you have a wooden deck, you’ll probably also want to stain and reseal it to prevent water damage and prolong its life.</li>\n<li><strong>Inspect your HVAC system</strong>: Check the <a href=\"/blog/does-home-insurance-cover-hvac/\">air conditioner and heat</a>, plus ducts. This may be a job for a professional. If you have radiator heat, spring is a good time to drain your boiler for the off season.</li>\n<li><strong>Paint as needed</strong>: Painting the exterior of your house adds an extra layer of protection to wooden exterior fixtures like shutters. This can prevent water from getting in and causing rot. (Plus, it just looks nice).</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>35k people visit the ER each year for lawn mower injuries</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"homemaintenancetipsforsummer\">Home maintenance tips for summer</h3>\n<p><strong>Dates</strong>: June 21 – September 22</p>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong>: 13 weeks</p>\n<p>Summer’s warmer temperatures and extra daylight make it the perfect time to tackle maintenance projects on your home’s exterior, even if you’re at work most of the day. And if you’re dreading the sound of “maintenance” in your time off, remember that a lot of these tasks are great excuses to spend more time outside. (And as we mentioned before: podcasts.)</p>\n<h4 id=\"propertyinsurancerelatedhomemaintenance-1\">Property insurance-related home maintenance</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Take care of exterior repairs and upgrades</strong>: This might include anything from painting to fixing the porch to planting the apple tree you’ve always wanted. This kind or repair might also include patching holes where water could get in and clearing debris after <a href=\"/blog/effects-of-thunderstorms/\">major summer storms</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Check and clean the dryer vent</strong>: Clogged dryer vents cause more than 15,000 fires per year. Keeping yours clear of lint goes a long way toward fire prevention. While you’re at it, take a look at other exhaust vents leading out of your home and make sure they’re also clear.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Clogged dryer vents cause <span data-a11y-number>15k</span> fires per year</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"generalupkeephomemaintenance-1\">General upkeep home maintenance</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Garden</strong>: We get it. Gardening’s not for everyone. But if you’re a first-time homeowner, you’ve got a whole new world of opportunity before you. Keeping a garden is a great way to spend time outside during the summer and it forces you to pay attention to things around your house that you might not otherwise notice. If you do try a garden, make a habit of pulling weeds every week, and check every day or so to see what needs water.</li>\n<li><strong>Point your ceiling fan blades the right way</strong>: They should be going counter-clockwise for summer. While you’re checking, dust those babies off!</li>\n<li><strong>Prepare for heat</strong>: If you want to stay comfortable without spending a ton of money on your A/C bill, make sure the weather-stripping along your windows and doors is in good condition (and update what’s not). Invest in curtains to block direct sunlight, especially for south- and west-facing windows. Consider planting deciduous trees on the south and west sides, too. These will offer cooling shade in the hot months and let sunlight in during the winter.</li>\n<li><strong>Prepare for storms</strong>: Summer storms range from the lightning blast that zaps the power for thirty minutes to all-out hurricanes that leave you without utilities for days or weeks. Even if there’s no major storm in the forecast, make sure you’ve got bottled water and battery-powered flashlights handy.</li>\n<li><strong>Prevent or eradicate bugs and other pests</strong>: Don’t wait for unwelcome visitors to take action. Seal holes where mice and roaches can get in. Keep ant killer on hand. Inspect wood for signs of <a href=\"/blog/does-home-insurance-cover-termite-damage/\">termite damage</a>. If you’re traveling, always check for bedbugs, and if you think you may have been exposed, wash and dry everything on the highest heat settings before letting it back into your house. Another way to prevent pests from getting inside is to keep plants from getting too close (especially peonies, which ants LOVE).</li>\n<li><strong>Clean window wells</strong>: These can accumulate all kinds of stuff over the course of the year. Making a point to clean them out will prevent anything unwanted from rotting, smelling, or taking root.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Landscaping can increase the value of your home from 5 – 12.5%</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"homemaintenancetipsforfall\">Home maintenance tips for fall</h3>\n<p><strong>Dates</strong>: September 22 – December 21</p>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong>: 14 weeks</p>\n<p>Fall home maintenance is all about battening down the hatches and getting ready for winter. It’s also a good excuse to spend a little more time outside before winter clenches its icy paws around the northern hemisphere.</p>\n<h4 id=\"propertyinsurancerelatedhomemaintenance-2\">Property insurance-related home maintenance</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Turn off exterior faucets and train hoses</strong>: Be sure to flush the faucets, too. This is crucial to make sure water doesn’t freeze in external pipes; if it does, it could burst them, which could translate to serious property damage that you don’t want to deal with.</li>\n<li><strong>Clean the gutters and inspect your downspouts</strong>: Once the leaves have stopped falling, make sure your gutters are clean and ready for the winter. The less stuff in there, the less likely they’ll be to come off in a storm or under the weight of snow and ice. Make sure, too, that your downspouts are pointing away from your home’s foundation so that any meltwater goes away from your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Inspect your heating system</strong>: Whether you have radiators or heating ducts, a clean, well-maintained system will run better, keep you warmer, and use less energy. If you have a boiler, you may need to drain it to clear sediment. You may also want to bring in a plumber to check that your radiator valves are in good working order so that the heat comes out when you need it.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your smoke alarm and carbon monoxide detectors</strong>: This home maintenance task takes just a few seconds but can save your life. Again, we recommend tackling this when you change your clocks.</li>\n<li><strong>Insulate pipes if necessary</strong>: Any pipes that tend to get cold (like those in under-sink cabinets) might benefit from insulation, especially if you’d rather not leave your cabinet doors open during the coldest weather. A layer of insulation can prevent freezing and bursting.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>21% of home fire deaths were in houses with non-working smoke alarms</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"personalliabilityinsurancerelatedhomemaintenancetips\">Personal liability insurance-related home maintenance tips</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check for (and seal) cracks in the driveway and sidewalk</strong>: Left untended, small cracks can expand during the winter, as water gets in and freezes. The good news: if you tackle cracks when they’re small, you can prevent expensive repaving work.</li>\n<li><strong>Stock up on winter gear</strong>: Fall is the time to make sure your snow shovel works (and is findable) and you’ve got salt for the sidewalk. Keeping walkways clear of snow and ice can prevent slip-and-fall injuries and therefore personal liability or medical expenses claims on your insurance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"generalupkeephomemaintenance-2\">General upkeep home maintenance</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plant next spring’s perennials</strong>: Want daffodils in March? Plant them now! An afternoon in the yard at this time of year can set you up for a really blossomy spring, which (trust us) will be just what you’re in the mood for after winter’s done with you.</li>\n<li><strong>Take care of leaves</strong>: The best news about leaves is that you can often just mow right over them instead of raking and bagging. The mowing approach is usually better for your lawn, too: leave the leaf bits in place, and they’ll help fertilize the whole yard. Or you can gather them in your mower’s bag and add them to a compost pile.</li>\n<li><strong>Close up the pool</strong> (if you have one): Sigh. It’s never fun to admit that swimming season is over, but it’s crucial if you want to ensure that you’ll have a swimming hole again next year. This is a great maintenance chore to outsource if you’re not a pool expert.</li>\n<li><strong>Stock up and store firewood</strong> (if you’ve got a fireplace): Set yourself up for cozy nights in front of the fireplace by ordering firewood now. Or chopping some! But make sure you don’t store it on the ground, where it can get moldy, or inside, where it can attract bugs. Build a wooden cradle and cover it with a tarp, and you’ll have nice, dry wood all winter long.</li>\n<li><strong>Seal the house</strong>: Make sure your doors and windows aren’t letting in any drafts; if they are, tighten, seal, and caulk as needed. Then install storm windows and doors to keep the cold air out.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"homemaintenancetipsforwinter\">Home maintenance tips for winter</h3>\n<p><strong>Dates</strong>: December 22 – March 19</p>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong>: 13 weeks</p>\n<p>The key to winter home maintenance is catching things early. Unchecked, cold temperatures can wreak havoc on various systems in your house. But a little prevention goes a long way.</p>\n<h4 id=\"propertyinsurancerelatedhomemaintenance-3\">Property insurance-related home maintenance</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep an eye out for icicles and ice dams</strong>: Get rid of them as soon as you see them, as they can wrench apart seams and let water into your house. One way to prevent ice from forming is with a snow cutter, which lets you brush snow off the roof as it falls. If you do see icicles, take a trip to the attic to make sure no water is getting in.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintain your heating system</strong>: Check your air filters about once a month, as some need changing that often. If you’ve got a boiler, make sure its water level doesn’t get too low or too high.</li>\n<li><strong>Open sink cabinets to prevent pipe freezing</strong>: If you didn’t get around to insulating under-sink pipes, you can prevent freezing by opening cabinets on the coldest days. This helps warm air circulate.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep the temperature at at least 55º F</strong>: Even if you’re traveling, maintain the 55º temperature, which will prevent frozen pipes and all the headaches that come with them.</li>\n<li><strong>Clean the hood filters on your range</strong>: Some experts recommend doing this as often as once a month. You can make this an easy job by putting the filter in a sink (or bucket) filled with water and water-based automotive degreaser. Let it soak for a while, and you shouldn’t have to do much scrubbing at all. Keeping your hood filter clean can help prevent kitchen fires.</li>\n<li><strong>Check the caulking around tubs and showers</strong>: Touch up anything that needs it to prevent leaking and water damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>US fire department respond to 17,200 cooking-related home fires every year</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"personalliabilityinsurancerelatedhomemaintenancetips-1\">Personal liability insurance-related home maintenance tips</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep walkways clear and de-iced</strong>: Ordering holiday gifts online? Then keep in mind that your delivery driver may be a part-time contract worker and not have access to benefits like workers’ compensation insurance. So if they slip and fall on your icy sidewalk, they could sue you to cover their medical costs and lost wages. And yes, that’s a worst-case scenario. But it’s important to keep in mind that the stakes are high for keeping your walkways clear.</li>\n<li><strong>Eliminate icicles as they form</strong>: In addition to protecting your property, this can prevent unfortunate falling-ice injuries to your guests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"generalupkeephomemaintenance-3\">General upkeep home maintenance</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tighten what’s loose</strong>: When the weather’s really nasty, spend an afternoon testing door knobs, handles, windows, and anything else that can get loose. Tighten up what’s rattling.</li>\n<li><strong>Check locks and deadbolts</strong>: Anything that locks (doors, windows, etc.) can break. Repair or replace locks that are no longer working.</li>\n<li><strong>Clean the garbage disposal</strong> (if you have one): Do this as often as you need it. One easy method: freeze white vinegar in to ice cubes, then put them into your disposal and run it. Follow it up with some hot water, and you should eliminate any unpleasant odors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"part2quickhomemaintenanceguide\">Part 2: Quick home maintenance guide</h2>\n<p>If you just read through those tips thinking, “Yes, but <em>how</em> do I do all of that?” then this section is for you.

That means that, if your hot-water heater gives out after 15 years of solid performance, your insurance won’t pay for you to buy a new one – replacing certain appliances is an expected part of owning a home.</p>\n<p>But there’s a second part to this exclusion: if you don’t perform home maintenance regularly and damage happens to your home that would normally be covered – but that could have been prevented by proper maintenance – your insurance policy may not cover that damage.</p>\n<p>If you didn’t already take home maintenance seriously, that’s a good reason to start doing so. Think of it as just one more benefit of keeping your home in top shape, besides increasing its value and making it a better place to live for yourself and your family.</p>\n<p>Happy housework, everyone!</p>"

Use these tips to identify hazards so you can address them immediately. That’s a great way to prevent losses and injuries.</p>\n<h3 id=\"kitchen\">Kitchen</h3>\n<p>People often say the kitchen is the heart of the home, but the equipment in it does pose some risks. Below are a few safety tips for your kitchen.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check your appliances and keep them clean.</strong> Removing the excess grease that can accumulate in ovens and stovetops over time can help reduce your risk of fire.</li>\n<li><strong>Clean up spills immediately.</strong> You might not want to stop cooking when preparing a meal, but spills may cause unsuspecting people to slip and fall.</li>\n<li><strong>Make sure knives are sharp.</strong> Believe it or not, but <a href=\"https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=1&contentid=263\">dull knives cause more injuries</a> than sharp knives because they require more pressure to cut.

Perhaps even more troubling, though, is that the number of people who are “substantially” affected by hurricane damage is projected to increase by more than 700 percent in that same timeframe, from 1.2 million to 10 million people.</p>\n<p>| Yearly Hurricane Impact | Today | In 2075 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total spend | $28 billion | $39 billion |\n| Federal spend | $18 billion | $24 billion |\n| People “substantially affected” | 1.2 million | 10 million |</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/presentation/53244-presentation.pdf\"><em>Source</em></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"top5mostexpensivehurricanes\">Top 5 most expensive hurricanes</h2>\n<p>The CBO’s predictions of increasing hurricane costs ring true to anyone who’s paid attention to storms in the last few years.

For the period between June 2017 and May 2018, those averages ranged from $11,015 (for May 2018) to a whopping $113,016 (for August 2017, when Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit).</p>\n<h2 id=\"flooddamagetakeaways\">Flood damage takeaways</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Flood damage is always expensive</strong>. Even on the low end, $11,000+ in damages is a lot. If you’re not insured, those costs have to come out of your pocket.</li>\n<li><strong>Flood insurance doesn’t cover everything</strong>. NFIP policies <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/flood-insurance/what-flood-insurance-does-and-does-not-cover/\"><strong>only cover up to $250,000 in structural damage</strong></a> (i.e., rebuilding your home) and $100,000 in contents (i.e., replacing damaged stuff in your house). Most policies also exclude coverage of anything kept in a basement or crawlspace.</li>\n<li><strong>More than one in five claims the NFIP pays are for homes considered to have a low or moderate risk of flooding</strong>. So even if you don’t live in what’s considered a flood zone, you may want to invest in flood insurance to prevent a major unexpected expense in the event of a flood.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"keepaneyeonthenexthurricane\">Keep an eye on the next hurricane</h2>\n<p>Regularly check <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/?atlc\">this NOAA map</a> of hurricane activity in the Atlantic.

Typical homeowners policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DO</strong> cover wind damage related to hurricanes. This portion of the coverage is sometimes called <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>DO</strong> have a separate deductible for hurricane-related damages. This is called a <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>DO NOT</strong> cover flooding from hurricanes. For that coverage, you’ll need to purchase a separate flood insurance policy (typically from the <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/national-flood-insurance-program\">NFIP</a>, though Kin can help you get coverage, too).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howtoprepareforahurricane\">How to prepare for a hurricane</h2>\n<p>Ever heard that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure? It’s a cliché, but it’s highly applicable to hurricane preparation. Your best bet at minimizing the damage a hurricane can cause is to prepare in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Prepare your home to survive the high wind and water</strong>. This includes both long-term planning like making sure your roof meets <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">wind mitigation</a> standards and <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-proof-your-home/\">short-term hurricane-proofing</a> you can do once you know a storm is coming.</li>\n<li><strong>Plan short-term living alternatives</strong>. This involves planning where you’ll go if and when you get an evacuation order.

Here’s a <a href=\"/blog/flood-claims-process/\">guide to handling the flood claims process</a>. The most important takeaway: start the process sooner rather than later to ensure you’re able to get the compensation you need to recover.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatnottodoafterahurricane\">What not to do after a hurricane</h2>\n<p>When the storm has passed, you’ll likely want to get your life back to normal as soon as possible. But keep in mind that full recovery may take some time, especially if the damage is severe or widespread. To make sure you don’t put yourself or your family at risk, be sure you follow these safety guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DON’T</strong> return to your home if there is still an active evacuation order.</li>\n<li><strong>DON’T</strong> try to wade, swim, or drive through standing water.</li>\n<li><strong>DON’T</strong> touch downed power lines; instead, report them to the police or fire department.</li>\n<li><strong>DON’T</strong> use generators indoors, including in a garage, crawlspace, or basement. Before refilling a generator with gas, let it cool off first.</li>\n<li><strong>DON’T</strong> burn charcoal indoors.</li>\n<li><strong>DON’T</strong> eat or drink anything unless you know it’s safe.
